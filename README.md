### **Design Choices**

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a color scheme that matches the atmosphere of a playful Trivia Game.
For this website I have deciced to keep design simple but playful in order to not take the attention away from the game.

<a></a>
#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the title of my game, I have used the font [Kalam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam?query=kalam "Kalam") 
and for the main text I have used [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair "Playfair Display"). 
The title is a handwritten fonts that give a more personal and playful feeling.

<a></a>
#### Icons
I will use some icons for the buttons but I will make sure that the icons are self-explanatory so it doesn't confuse the user.

<a></a>
#### Colors

Like I mentioned before, I have decided to use some colors that fit well with the feeling of a game.
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.

![Color Palette](wireframes/color-palette.png)

* #54455F: This purple color I will use as a background for all the different pages on the website. 
* #7C3C4A: This pink / red color I will use to highlight the buttons on the page. 
* #FCF3EE: This will be my text color for the overall website.

I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>
#### Structure
I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Testing**

### Category Selection

* Plan  
When page is loaded, the user should have the possibility to choose the category for the game they want to play. 
The user shouldn't be able to proceed when no category is chosen.

* Implementation  
Created a select box in index.html and using javascript I added an option for each category.

* Test  
I have tested all selecting all the different categories to make sure the correct questions are being showed. 
Option with 'Please choose your category' has been disabled so the user can only choose one of the categories.

* Result  
Category selection works as planned and shows nicely on the various browsers and devices.

* Verdict  
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### Answer Validation

* Plan  
When correct answer was selected, the choice should highlight in a green color and show a 'thumbs up' icon. 
When the wrong answer was selected, the choice should highlight in a red color and a message should pop up with the correct answer.

* Implementation  
Adding a function in game.js which validates the answer and adds classes to highlight the relevant choice and message.
Added a setTimeout function to make sure that the user has sufficient time to see if answer was correct or not. 
I added more time to the Timeout function when answered incorrectly to make sure the user has enough time to read correct answer.

* Test  
I tested the answer validation across various devices and browers to make sure it works as planned.
Relevant color and message is being highlighted.

* Result  
Answer validation is working as expected on different browsers and devices.

* Verdict 
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### Question Counter

* Plan  
Original plan was to have a question counter next to the score on the game. 
After implementing this, I have decided to change my original idea to show a progress bar instead of the question counter. 
The reason for this, is because I think it is a better user experience for the user. 

* Implementation  
I have added 2 div elements, once for the outer progress bar and one for the inner. 
In order to make the progress bar update whenever you go to the next question, I have added the innerhtml (for the text) and added width in the fetchNewQuestion function. 
This by adding a calculation that calculates the percentage of your current position in the game. 
I have decided to start the progress bar with the first question at 0% instead of 10% as for me it seemed more logical.
It only moves to 10% when the first question is answered. 

* Test  
I have tested the progress bar across different devices and browers to make sure it works accordingly. 
Progress bar is reacts responsive and for me it has a better result for user experience.

* Result  
Progress bar works as planned across various devices and browsers. 

* Verdict 
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### Score Tracker

* Plan  
The plan was to implement a field above the question, displaying the current score of the user which increases when the user selects correct answer.
Final result should be displayed on the end screen after completing the game. 

* Implementation  
Added score field to index.html and added function in game.js in order to increase the score by 10 (using the pointsCorrectAnswer variable).
When game is starting, score is set to 0 and only when the answer was correct, the function increaseScore is being executed. 
Added as well a field on the section end screen to display the total score when game is completed. 

* Test  
I have tested this feature with various categories and across various browers and devices. 
Score is incremented correctly when answering correct and stays the same when the answer was wrong. 
Correct total score is being displayed on the end screen.

* Result  
Score display and total score is working as planned across various browsers and devices and increments when answer is correct. 

* Verdict 
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### Personalised message on end screen
* Plan 
On the endscreen after completing the game, I wanted to have a personalised message depending on the final score that the user got. 

* Implementation 
In the fetchNewQuestion function (when available question is 0), I have added a if statement that evaluates the total score of the user. 
Depending on the result, a different message is loaded on the endscreen. 

* Test 
I have tested all the different possibilites that I have implemented to make sure the correct message was being displayed. 

* Result
The correct message is being displayed on the endscreen depending on the total score of the user. 

* Verdict 
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

## **Bugs**

### Double click on answer

* Bug
When you click on answer and within 1 second you click on another answer, it still validates, goes to the next question and already considers that question answered.   

* Fix     
Define variable accepting answers and setting it to false.
Enable accepting answers once question is loaded.
When choice is clicked, set accepting answers to false.  

* Verdict  
Only able to answer question once and does not automatically answer question. Bug resolved. 

### Question and answer not showing nicely

* Bug
Quotes were not being displaying nicely in the fetched questions and answers.

* Fix 
Updated the innerText to innerHTML in game.js 

* Verdict
Quotes are now showing as they should. Bug fixed.

## **Credits**

* The youtube channel of [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-T8W79DN6PBnzomelvqJYw) has really helped me to get started on this project. 

* I would like to thank my mentor Simen [Eventyret_mentor](https://github.com/Eventyret) for first of all, challenging me to start this project
and of course also for helping me get started and guiding me in the good direction whenever I had the feeling I couldn't do it. 

* Last but not least, I would also like to thank my partner Artur and my parents for testing testing testing and giving me feedback about the game. 
It has really helped me to improve the game and make it even more user friendly. 


## **Closing Note** 
When I started this project, I had no idea how to begin. After a lot of research online, watching various movies and talking to my mentor I took my first steps into this project. 
Along the way I was not always sure I was going to be able to bring this project to a good end but I am incredibly happy I continued on this road and didn't give up. 
I really have the feeling I learned so much with this project about the complex world of JavaScript.
