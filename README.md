### **User Stories**

* As a user, I would like to be able to pick a category
* As a user, I would like to track my score during the game. 
* As a user, I expect a variey of questions so no questions get repeated.
* As a user, I would like to know the correct answer when answered incorrectly.
* As a user, I expect that the game has a nice visually appealing lay out to be in line with the game.

1. As a user of a game, the first impression is very important. 
When you want to play a game you already want to get the happy feeling as of the moment you open the website.
All the different pages should be in the same style to make it as a whole.

1. When I play a game I also like to learn something new. Therefor it's very important to me that the same questions are not repeating themselves.
And as I am less interested in questions about Geography for example, I would really enjoy being able to pick a category that interests me. 

1. As a user, I want the webiste to be easy to use. I prefer not to have too many buttons or options. 
I just want to be able to play the game, check my score and play again and again!

### **Design Choices**

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a color scheme that matches the atmosphere of a playful Trivia Game.
For this website I have deciced to keep design simple but playful in order to not take the attention away from the game.

<a></a>
#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the title of my game, I have used the font [Kalam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam?query=kalam "Kalam") 
and for the main text I have used [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair "Playfair Display"). 
The title is a handwritten fonts that give a more personal and playful feeling.

<a></a>
#### Icons
I will use some icons for the buttons but I will make sure that the icons are self-explanatory so it doesn't confuse the user.

<a></a>
#### Colors

Like I mentioned before, I have decided to use some colors that fit well with the feeling of a game.
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.

![Color Palette](wireframes/color-palette.png)

* #54455F: This purple color I will use as a background for all the different pages on the website. 
* #7C3C4A: This pink / red color I will use to highlight the buttons on the page. 
* #FCF3EE: This will be my text color for the overall website.

I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>
#### Structure
I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Bugs**

### Double click on answer

* Bug
When you click on answer and within 1 second you click on another answer, it still validates, goes to the next question and already considers that question answered.   

* Fix     
Define variable accepting answers and setting it to false.
Enable accepting answers once question is loaded.
When choice is clicked, set accepting answers to false.  

* Verdict  
Only able to answer question once and does not automatically answer question. Bug resolved. 

### Question and answer not showing nicely

* Bug
Quotes were not being displaying nicely in the fetched questions and answers.

* Fix 
Updated the innerText to innerHTML in game.js 

* Verdict
Quotes are now showing as they should. Bug fixed.
